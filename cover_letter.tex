%%% Points to hit
% Experience with building computational models of brain and/or behavior, including simulation, fitting, and experimental design.
% Experience analyzing neuroscientific experimental data.
% Proficiency in high-quality scientific/mathematical coding in more than one commonly used language, such as Python, C, C , Fortran, julia or MATLAB. Experience with HPC, GPU and/or code profiling and optimization a plus.
% Proficiency with git and GitHub or other version control frameworks.
% Proficiency with modern machine learning frameworks for autodifferentiation and GPU computing, preferably JAX and PyTorch.
% Knowledge of software engineering practices for working in groups, including software development life cycles, coding standards, code review and version control systems (git).
% Appropriate applied mathematical training (linear algebra, differential equations, etc.)
% Postdoctoral experience in  neuroscience, data science, computer science, engineering, mathematics or related technical discipline.
% Experience with open source communities and tools, especially in a research or educational context.
% Experience with community management and engagement, with a focus on teaching and knowledge sharing.
% Experience writing technical communication and documentation, and creating websites to host them.
% Experience with continuous integration or other software testing frameworks.
% Experience running software-oriented workshops or educational programs.
% How the applicant envisions their participation in the CCN scientific research environment.

% Blockchain technology is of interest to me: creating distributed ledgers without risk of trusting or storing in any single authority.  What is much more than a passing interest: Ethereum's smart contracts.  Finally, we can move beyond the risk of third parties.  Finally, applications can run without censorship or downtime.  It's such a powerful paradigm and I want to be a part of its early growth.  You don't need me to expound on the features of Ethereum though.  It is only important that you understand that I will spend my most valuable of resources pursuing this: my time and creativity.  I want to create the infrastructure that cities run on.  I want disrupt the systems people use every day, and to do it so smoothly that they can't imagine how it used to be.  I intend to pursue this program.

% A little bit about me: I love distributed systems and I geek out for version control. My friends listen to me wax poetically about the explicit beauty of Python, though I look forward to developing in newer languages and frameworks like Julia and React.  I dabble in DevOps and appreciate the importance of packaging. Listening is my absolute strength and I give only one form of attention: undivided.  That goes for individuals and towards projects. 

% Allow me to philosophize over questions of architecture, give me the latitude and freedom to explore ideas and I'll give you an exquisite system. Research, research, research - I prefer to synthesize different constructs into one whole, taking from the brilliant work of others or creating my own as needed; always through a thorough consideration of all components and their alternatives. A few bullets on me:

% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%   \item Project driven
%   \item Elegant forms over minute details
%   %\item New project architecture over maintenance
%   \item Open source
%   \item Distributed systems
%   \item Proven best practices
% \end{itemize}

% I hope you will find me a good fit for this program,

% William
