Blockchain technology is of interest to me: creating distributed ledgers without risk of trusting or storing in any single authority.  What is much more than a passing interest: Ethereum's smart contracts.  Finally, we can move beyond the risk of third parties.  Finally, applications can run without censorship or downtime.  It's such a powerful paradigm and I want to be a part of its early growth.  You don't need me to expound on the features of Ethereum though.  It is only important that you understand that I will spend my most valuable of resources pursuing this: my time and creativity.  I want to create the infrastructure that cities run on.  I want disrupt the systems people use every day, and to do it so smoothly that they can't imagine how it used to be.  I intend to pursue this program.

A little bit about me: I love distributed systems and I geek out for version control. My friends listen to me wax poetically about the explicit beauty of Python, though I look forward to developing in newer languages and frameworks like Julia and React.  I dabble in DevOps and appreciate the importance of packaging. Listening is my absolute strength and I give only one form of attention: undivided.  That goes for individuals and towards projects. 

Allow me to philosophize over questions of architecture, give me the latitude and freedom to explore ideas and I'll give you an exquisite system. Research, research, research - I prefer to synthesize different constructs into one whole, taking from the brilliant work of others or creating my own as needed; always through a thorough consideration of all components and their alternatives. A few bullets on me:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Project driven
  \item Elegant forms over minute details
  %\item New project architecture over maintenance
  \item Open source
  \item Distributed systems
  \item Proven best practices
\end{itemize}

I hope you will find me a good fit for this program,

William
