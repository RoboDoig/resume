      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Improved and extended the popular Bonsai-Rx language for visual reactive programming.} \\
        Built and released Bonsai libraries for sensor interfaces (Tinkerforge), networking (ZeroMQ, Zyre, Lsl), streaming (FFmpeg) and Unity integration.
        \item {Developed Unity VR environments in collaboration with clients in research and industry.} \\
        With partners in clinical and sociological research, developed environments based on real-world city locations that participants can explore in VR while having key biophysical and attention signals monitored (heart-rate, galvanic skin response, eye-tracking, gaze fixation).
        \item {Worked with NeuroGEARS team to provide bespoke software tools to clients including user interfaces and documentation. Used reactive extensions in .NET and asynchronous programming to produce Bonsai-Rx workflows controlling complex neuroscience experiments. Communicated engineering process and requirements to non-technical clients.}
