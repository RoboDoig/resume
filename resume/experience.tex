      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Contributor to the popular open source Bonsai-Rx language for visual reactive programming.} \\
        Built and released Bonsai libraries for sensor interfaces (Tinkerforge), networking (ZeroMQ, Zyre, Lsl), and Unity integration.
        \item {Supported Bonsai users through documentation and training.} \\
        Produced and contributed to several deployed documentation webistes (docfx) containing autodocumented code reference and tutorials. Trained lab members of academic collaborators in effective Git practices for managing open-source software projects. Engaged in technical support of Bonsai users via support forums.
        \item {Worked with NeuroGEARS team to provide bespoke software tools to clients including user interfaces and documentation. Used reactive extensions in .NET and asynchronous programming to produce Bonsai-Rx workflows controlling complex neuroscience experiments. Communicated engineering process and requirements to non-technical clients.}
